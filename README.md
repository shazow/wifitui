- [x] Non-interactive modes (`list` `show` `connect` commands)
- [x] Bring your own color scheme and theme (`--theme=./theme.toml` or set `WIFITUI_THEME=./theme.toml`)

## Getting Started

Install [the latest release](https://github.com/shazow/wifitui/releases/) on your fav distro (wifitui is [not in all package managers yet](https://github.com/shazow/wifitui/issues/48)), here's a handy script for convenience:

```shell
# Fetch the latest release version
TAG=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/shazow/wifitui/releases/latest | grep "tag_name" | cut -d '"' -f4)
OS="linux-$(uname -m)" # x86_64 or arm64
LATEST_RELEASE="https://github.com/shazow/wifitui/releases/download/${TAG}/wifitui-${TAG:1}-${OS}"

# Just the binary (any distro)
wget -q -O- "${LATEST_RELEASE}.tar.gz" | tar xzv

# Debian
sudo apt install "${LATEST_RELEASE}.deb"

# Arch Linux (from AUR)
yay -S wifitui-bin

# Arch Linux (latest release from this repo)
sudo pacman-key --recv-keys 065D66BF7EFEB02BCDC75FF6227578D96B6A5E4C
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 065D66BF7EFEB02BCDC75FF6227578D96B6A5E4C
sudo pacman -U "${LATEST_RELEASE}.pkg.tar.zst"
```


If you have nix, you can run the latest code in one command:

```
nix run github:shazow/wifitui
```

Run the TUI:

```
$ wifitui
```

Or run it in non-interactive mode:

```console
$ ./wifitui --help
USAGE
  wifitui [flags] <subcommand> [args...]

SUBCOMMANDS
  list     List wifi networks
  show     Show a wifi network
  connect  Connect to a wifi network

FLAGS
  -version=false  display version

$ ./wifitui show --json "GET off my LAN"
{
  "SSID": "GET off my LAN",
  "IsActive": false,
  "IsKnown": false,
  "IsSecure": false,
  "IsVisible": false,
  "IsHidden": false,
  "Strength": 0,
  "Security": 3,
  "LastConnected": null,
  "AutoConnect": false
}
```

##  Why not `nmtui` or `impala`?

Each has features the other lacks: `nmtui` can reveal passphrases but can't trigger a rescan, `impala` can rescan but can't manage saved networks (partly due to being iwd-exclusive), etc. I used both for a while, but I just wanted one tool that does everything, plus sort by recency, fuzzy filtering, QR code for sharing the network, support multiple backends (nm and iwd), and more.
